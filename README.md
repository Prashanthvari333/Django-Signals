# Django Signals Example
This repository demonstrates the default behavior of Django signals, including their synchronous execution, running in the same thread as the caller, and participation in the same database transaction as the caller. The project is built using Django with examples that cover:

  -Synchronous execution of signals
  -Signals running in the same thread
  -Signals and database transactions
